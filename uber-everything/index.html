David Baunach<br><br>2022.07.12<br><br>The business model of Uber has been intriguing to me since they launched in 2009.<br><br>A cab company that didn't own any vehicles, didn't really have employees, but offered employment with a low threshold of<br>requirements: a vehicle and a drivers license.<br><br>This also allowed for some immediate savings on the part of customers using the service: all Uber needed to exist was a<br>slim commission, while the rest of the fare went to the driver.<br><br>Boiling it down: Uber was able to get rid of a lot of the managerial bloat which bogs down most traditional companies,<br>and keeping things lean by essentially contracting out as many positions as possible, to keep prices to a minimum, and<br>thus allowing them to expand at a ridiculous rate.<br><br>The Model<br><br>This model can only work using a protocol or application layer to remove basic management from the equation.<br><br>There are three layers: necessary management (legal team, tech support and development, customer service, executive staff),<br>the app or protocol, and the workers.<br><br>What is stopping us from using this model in other fields?<br><br>Use it for Everything!<br><br>I've had various ideas over the years about where this model could be used. I'd say my two best were for urban farming, and<br>for journalism. I'll give a brief explanation of these two, but ultimately, I think the model could be used for literally<br>everything we use traditional business models for now.<br><br>Urban Farming:<br><br>Front lawns are wasted space, imagine being able to rent out your lawn, someone grows crops on it, and you get a cut of the<br>profits once they are harvested and sold.<br><br>On the company side of things, same as Uber, all they're really doing is connecting people that want to urban farm, with<br>people who want to rent out their yards.<br><br>It'll probably be a little more akin to AirBnB, since there will need to be more communication between the farmers and those<br>renting out their yards, but all that could easily be accomplished through an app.<br><br>And it will tie in well with existing infrastructure: farmers markets will have produce being grown literally in it's own<br>backyard, and those who want to get into urban farming without owning land will have an option.<br><br>Journalism:<br><br>Imagine that anyone, in the vicinity of a news-worthy event, could immediately report on the basic who, what, when, and where<br>or that event, and get reimbursed for that reporting.<br><br>Again, just like Uber, the company part just has to connect those that are willing to make such reports, with those that want<br>that information.<br><br>It also ties into existing infrastructure: major news articles will get the basic information faster, can run their stories<br>quicker, and independent fact checkers will have open access to verify that info.<br><br>In this case a subscription or ad based revenue model would probably be necessary, and great care would need to be taken in<br>dispersal of those funds to the reporters who make genuinely helpful reports, but these are difficulties that can be overcome,<br>not insurmountable problems.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>The Uber model of using technology to connect independent contractors with customers, with the company in between only providing<br>the necessary services in connecting the two, is a method that can be widely used. I gave the examples of urban farming and<br>journalism, but really, the sky is the limit. My hope is we'll see many fields of business embrace this model in the coming years.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 2022.07.19</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="file:///C:\Users\david\Documents\Publii\sites\fr-david-baunach\preview/tags/blog/index.html">Blog</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=file%3A%2F%2F%2FC%3A%5CUsers%5Cdavid%5CDocuments%5CPublii%5Csites%5Cfr-david-baunach%5Cpreview%2Fuber-everything%2Findex.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="file:///C:/Users/david/Documents/Publii/sites/fr-david-baunach/preview/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=file%3A%2F%2F%2FC%3A%5CUsers%5Cdavid%5CDocuments%5CPublii%5Csites%5Cfr-david-baunach%5Cpreview%2Fuber-everything%2Findex.html&amp;via=%40davidbaunach&amp;text=Uber%20Everything!" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="file:///C:/Users/david/Documents/Publii/sites/fr-david-baunach/preview/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=file%3A%2F%2F%2FC%3A%5CUsers%5Cdavid%5CDocuments%5CPublii%5Csites%5Cfr-david-baunach%5Cpreview%2Fuber-everything%2Findex.html&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Uber%20Everything!" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="file:///C:/Users/david/Documents/Publii/sites/fr-david-baunach/preview/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=file%3A%2F%2F%2FC%3A%5CUsers%5Cdavid%5CDocuments%5CPublii%5Csites%5Cfr-david-baunach%5Cpreview%2Fuber-everything%2Findex.html" class="js-share mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="file:///C:/Users/david/Documents/Publii/sites/fr-david-baunach/preview/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> <span>Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=file%3A%2F%2F%2FC%3A%5CUsers%5Cdavid%5CDocuments%5CPublii%5Csites%5Cfr-david-baunach%5Cpreview%2Fuber-everything%2Findex.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="file:///C:/Users/david/Documents/Publii/sites/fr-david-baunach/preview/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Uber%20Everything!&amp;url=file%3A%2F%2F%2FC%3A%5CUsers%5Cdavid%5CDocuments%5CPublii%5Csites%5Cfr-david-baunach%5Cpreview%2Fuber-everything%2Findex.html" class="js-share buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="file:///C:/Users/david/Documents/Publii/sites/fr-david-baunach/preview/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#buffer"/></svg> <span>Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Uber%20Everything!
